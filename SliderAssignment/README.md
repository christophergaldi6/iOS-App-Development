I am utilizing two of my late days for the class. I wasn't able to figure out how to set up the text field to update the slider until going to class, where you used the guard statement in your example, which was what I needed to be able to set the text field input value because I was trying to set it without and was getting errors and then tried to set up a listener but failed.
